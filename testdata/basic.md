This is a plain paragraph with no special formatting. It should wrap at the
terminal width when the line is long enough to exceed the available space.

This paragraph has **bold text**, *italic text*, and ~~strikethrough text~~.
It also has `inline code` and ***bold italic text*** combined.

Here is a paragraph with a soft break
that continues on the next line.

Here is a paragraph with a hard break\
that uses a backslash.

---

Another paragraph after a horizontal rule. This tests that thematic breaks
render correctly between content blocks.

Here is some `inline code with spaces` in the middle of a sentence.

**Bold** at the start. At the end is *italic*. And ~~struck through~~ in between.

A final paragraph to ensure scrolling works with enough content to fill the
viewport and then some. The status bar should show the current scroll position
as a percentage and the line numbers.
